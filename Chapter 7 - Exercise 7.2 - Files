#Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the ?le and look for lines of the form: X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
#When you encounter a line that starts with "X-DSPAM-Con?dence:" pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line.
#Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam con?dence values from these lines.
#When you reach the end of the file, print out the average spam con?dence. 
#Enter the file name: mbox.txt Average spam confidence: 0.894128046745
#Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt Average spam confidence: 0.750718518519
